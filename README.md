# IMGUI-Base

This project is a base boilerplate adapted from the ImGui example_glfw_vulkan project.

To use this base execute the following:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules git://github.com/Coincadink/IMGUI-Base
cd IMGUI-Base
cmake --build ./build --config Debug --target IMGUI-Base -j 6 --
```
This should generate an executable file within the builds folder which can be launched from file browser, or from command prompt.

This project is licensed under the MIT Licens so do with it what you would like :)
